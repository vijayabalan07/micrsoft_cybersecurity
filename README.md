This project focuses on improving the efficiency of Security Operation Centers (SOCs) by building a machine learning model that predicts the triage grade of cybersecurity incidents.
Leveraging the GUIDE dataset, the project categorizes incidents as True Positive (TP), Benign Positive (BP), or False Positive (FP). 
This solution supports guided response systems to enhance enterprise security posture.
